Now a panel of judges has ruled that more than 80 cases can be consolidated into federal court.\n\nThe stakes are high for both parties with implications extending to future Uber riders and drivers. The outcome of the case could result in sweeping changes to Uber\u2019s platform, which plaintiffs argue will reduce sexual assault and also raise new concerns over privacy.\n\nThe upshot? Technology lies at the center of this very human story.\n\nUber has attempted to address sexual assaults by drivers \u2014 which the lawsuits claim Uber has known about since 2014 \u2014 through new safety features in its app, like a 911 button and the ability to share location with a friend. Yet survivors, and their attorneys, say that response has been inadequate, and they\u2019re calling for better technological solutions like in-vehicle surveillance cameras.\n\nAside from the 911 button and location-sharing feature, which were both introduced in 2018, Uber has added other features to the app over the last five years.",

This case will differ slightly from Epic\u2019s battle with Apple on the same topic because, this time, Epic can\u2019t allege there\u2019s no other way to load apps onto Android devices, as it could with Apple, because Android does allow for sideloading apps.

The DOJ doubled down on this, saying Google has become the monopoly it denounced years ago.\n\nWhat does it all mean?\n\nThe case is expected to continue for several weeks, bringing to a head one of the biggest fights in tech antitrust since the U.S. took Microsoft to trial in the 1990s.\n\nIf the judge rules against Google, the outcome could look a lot like the Microsoft deal, in which the computer company was required to change its behavior and share its APIs with third-party developers. Microsoft was also banned from making anticompetitive and exclusive deals with computer manufacturers.",

Over the past couple of weeks, more of the inner workings of Google has come to light, including some of the search engine\u2019s most lucrative search queries, what the revenue-share agreements between Google and Android OEMs look like and why Expedia has a bone to pick with Google.\n\nBefore we go into some of these tidbits\u2026\n\nWhy the Google vs. U.S. antitrust case matters\n\nThe government has argued that Google uses its platforms and deals with partners to block out any competition in search or advertising, thus hindering competitors from accessing the data they\u2019d need to improve their products.",

As confirmed during a teleconference Wednesday, SBF will be taking the stand, along with a handful of other witnesses as the onus shifts toward the defense after the prosecution brought its case to its conclusion.\n\nAs former federal prosecutor Josh Naftalis told TechCrunch, SBF taking to the stand in his own trial is a \u201cHail Mary\u201d ahead of a verdict and potential sentencing for seven counts tied to fraud and money laundering.\n\n\u201cOnce it goes to cross[-examination], he doesn\u2019t get to say, \u2018I\u2019m done,\u2019\u201d Naftalis said.",

More on that later!\n\nWhat exactly is Epic claiming?\n\nEpic argues that Google makes it so difficult for developers and users to get around its Android app store, and that app store\u2019s standard fees, that it\u2019s created an illegal monopoly that unjustly enriches Google while artificially driving up app prices because other stores can\u2019t compete.\n\nEpic also claims that Google is illegally tying its Google Play payments platform to the Google Play app store, keeping other potential app payment mechanisms from competing as well.\n\nSo, does Google have a monopoly?\n\nA monopoly on what? That\u2019s one of the biggest questions the court will decide. Epic claims that Google has illegal monopolies in \u201cAndroid app distribution\u201d and \u201cAndroid in-app payment processing.\u201d It\u2019ll argue that if you buy or develop for Android phones, you\u2019re stuck paying the Google tax.",

A status quo where the vast, vast majority of Android app installs are from Google Play, with only a tiny sliver attributable to the Galaxy Store that comes preinstalled on every Samsung phone.\n\nThe future of Google\u2019s app store is at stake in a lawsuit by Fortnite publisher Epic Games. Epic sued Google in 2020 after a fight over in-app purchase fees, claiming the Android operating system\u2019s Google Play Store constituted an unlawful monopoly \u2014 while Google says its demands would damage Android\u2019s ability to offer a secure user experience and compete with Apple\u2019s iOS. Follow along with updates here.\n\nBornstein showed jurors charts of Google\u2019s fat app profit margins (70 percent on $12 billion in revenue a year, says Epic) and pointed out several ugly-seeming ways Google has allegedly attempted to keep anyone from taking that money away \u2014 like paying game developers not to build their own app stores or standalone app launchers like Epic did with Fortnite.",

You know, I think Apple is... it\u2019s a little bit unfortunate that in a lot of ways Apple\u2019s restrictions on competition are absolute. Thou shalt not have a competing store on iOS and thou shalt not use a competing payment method. And I think Apple should be receiving at least as harsh antitrust scrutiny as Google.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to me that because Google distributes the Android operating system as open source, they had to put all these deals out in the open.",

It will point out that not only does the Play Store compete with Apple\u2019s App Store, which the Ninth Circuit ruling in the Apple case agreed upon, too, but Android also supports competitive app stores like Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Store and Amazon\u2019s Appstore.\n\nEpic, however, will attempt to demonstrate that Google makes it hard for alternative app stores to succeed and reach consumers, noting that 90% of apps are still downloaded through Google Play.",

Though Epic will suggest Google makes that process cumbersome, the bulk of its arguments will center around what it believes are anticompetitive agreements between Google and device manufacturers and developers.\n\nThe precedent Epic\u2019s case will rely on is a Microsoft case where courts found Microsoft to have a monopoly over the operating system and were abusing it, making it hard for users to download alternative browsers, like Netscape, on Windows devices.\n\nTo make its case, Epic plans to bring claims under Sections 1 and 2 of U.S. antitrust law, the Sherman Act, as well as California\u2019s anticompetitive laws, the Cartwright Act, and the Unfair Competition Law.

On 22 October, Swift made her return to Arrowhead Stadium to watch as the Kansas City Chiefs won their game against the Los Angeles Chargers. The occasion marked Swift\u2019s fourth time attending one of Kelce\u2019s games, amid ongoing reports that they are dating.\n\nFollowing the event, Chariah Gordon, the partner of Kelce\u2019s teammate Mecole Hardman Jr, took to Instagram to share a snap of the singer and NFL player\u2019s sweet PDA moment. In the picture, Swift could be seen standing next to Kelce, reaching to kiss his cheek.\n\nIn addition to the kiss, the football star also had the perfect reaction to a fan calling him Swift\u2019s boyfriend. After a fan shouted: \u201cLet\u2019s go Taylor\u2019s boyfriend\u201d while Kelce was waiting for an elevator, he responded with a small smile on his face and by pumping his fist into the air.",

Our President of A&R, Jeremy Vuernick, has been crucial to working with me in this regard, as well as overseeing the making of our records. The company hadn\u2019t been consistently competitive in these areas for a very long time, and, remember: Motown had been spun off on its own long before I took the reins of the company. [Motown was spun out in early 2021, then returned to CMG in early 2023].",
